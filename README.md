Sometimes, Objective-C is just overly verbose. Life is too short to `enumerateObjectsUsingBlock` and who has the time to create sub-arrays with `filteredArrayUsingPredicate` anyway?

OpinionatedC is here to fix that. It offers a ton of **Smalltalk-style** convenience extension methods that make writing **concise, easily readable** Objective-C code a pleasure.

## Usage
The easiest way to include OpinionatedC into your project is through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/):
```
pod 'OpinionatedC'
```
Import the umbrella header everywhere you want to taste the sweetness of OpinionatedC:
```objectivec
#import <OpinionatedC/OpinionatedC.h>
```
#### A Note About Method Prefixes
There is no doubt that the best practice for extension methods in categories is to include a vendor prefix 
in the selector. Currently, OpinionatedC does not conform to that best practice, since having to write (and read)
stuff like `oc_each:` instead of a plain `each:` does not really seem to contribute to readability.

However, I'm currently looking for a method to allow optional, configurable method prefixes for users that
want (or need) them. Feel free to add to the discussion in [#1](https://github.com/leoschweizer/OpinionatedC/issues/1) if you have any ideas about this topic.

## Features
#### The **[complete list of features](https://leoschweizer.github.io/OpinionatedC/)** is available on the [official OpinionatedC website](https://leoschweizer.github.io/OpinionatedC/). 

Here is a small potpourri of what is possible with OpinionatedC:

```objectivec
[@[@"hello", @"world!"] average:^NSNumber*(id each) { 
    return @([each length]);
}]
// => @5.5

NSSet *set = [NSSet setWithObjects:@"foo", @"bar", @"hello", @"world!", nil];
[set groupedBy:^id(id each) {
    return @([each length]);
}]
// => @{
//        @3 : a NSSet(@"foo", @"bar"),
//        @5 : a NSSet(@"hello"),
//        @6 : a NSSet(@"world!")
//    }

[@[@"foo", @"bar"] each:^(NSString *each) {
    NSLog(@"%@", each);
}]
// => foo
// => bar

[@"abc" eachWithIndex:^(NSString *each, NSUInteger idx) {
    NSLog(@"%@ - %@", each, @(idx));
}]
// => a - 0
// => b - 1
// => c - 2

[@[@"a", @"b", @"c"] isEmpty]
// => NO

[@[@1, @2, @3] map:^id(NSNumber *each) {
    return @([each integerValue] * 2);
}]
// => @[@2, @4, @6]

[@[@1, @2, @3] inject:@0 into:^id(NSNumber *running, NSNumber *each) {
    return @([running integerValue] + [each integerValue]);
}]
// => @6

[@[@1, @2, @3, @4] allSatisfy:^BOOL(NSNumber *each) {
    return [each integerValue] % 2 == 0;
}]
// => NO

[@"abcdef" first:3]
// => @"abc"

[@{ @1 : @"foo", @2 : @"bar"} detect:^BOOL(OCAssociation *each) {
    return [each.key isEqualToNumber:@2];
}]
// => an OCAssociation(@2, @"bar")

[@{ @1 : @"foo", @2 : @"bar"} select:^BOOL(OCAssociation *each) {
    return [each.key isEqualToNumber:@2];
}]
// => @{ @2 : @"bar" }

[@{ @1 : @"foo", @2 : @"bar"} reject:^BOOL(OCAssociation *each) {
    return [each.key isEqualToNumber:@2];
}]
// => @{ @1 : @"foo" }

[@100 atRandom]
// => 77

[@3 timesRepeat:^{ 
   NSLog(@"hooray!"); 
}]
// => hooray
// => hooray
// => hooray

[[@1 to:@10] select:^id(NSNumber *each) {
    return [each integerValue] % 2 == 0;
}]
// => @[@2, @4, @6, @8, @10]
```
